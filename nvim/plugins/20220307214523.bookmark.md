unimpaired.vim {#unimpaired.vim dir="auto"}
--------------

Much of unimpaired.vim was extracted from my vimrc when I noticed a
pattern: complementary pairs of mappings. They mostly fall into four
categories.

There are mappings which are simply short normal mode aliases for
commonly used ex commands. `]q` is :cnext. `[q` is :cprevious. `]a` is
:next. `[b` is :bprevious. See the documentation for the full set of
20 mappings and mnemonics. All of them take a count.

There are linewise mappings. `[<Space>` and `]<Space>` add newlines
before and after the cursor line. `[e` and `]e` exchange the current
line with the one above or below it.

There are mappings for toggling options. `[os`, `]os`, and `yos` perform
`:set spell`, `:set nospell`, and `:set invspell`, respectively. There\'s also
`l` (`list`), `n` (`number`), `w` (`wrap`), `x` (`cursorline cursorcolumn`),
and several others, plus mappings to help alleviate the `set paste` dance.
Consult the documentation.

There are mappings for encoding and decoding. `[x` and `]x` encode and
decode XML (and HTML). `[u` and `]u` encode and decode URLs. `[y` and
`]y` do C String style escaping.

And in the miscellaneous category, there\'s `[f` and `]f` to go to the
next/previous file in the directory, and `[n` and `]n` to jump between
SCM conflict markers.

The `.` command works with all operator mappings, and will work with the
linewise mappings as well if you install
[repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat).

Installation {#installation dir="auto"}
------------

Install using your favorite package manager, or use Vim\'s built-in package
support:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
    cd ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
    git clone https://tpope.io/vim/unimpaired.git
    vim -u NONE -c "helptags unimpaired/doc" -c q

FAQ {#faq dir="auto"}
---

> My non-US keyboard makes it hard to type `[` and `]`. Can I configure
> different prefix characters?

The easiest solution is to map to `[` and `]` directly:

    nmap < [
    nmap > ]
    omap < [
    omap > ]
    xmap < [
    xmap > ]

Note we\'re not using the `noremap` family because we *do* want to recursively
invoke unimpaired.vim\'s maps.
