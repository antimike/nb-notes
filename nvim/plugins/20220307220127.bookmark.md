**Sort** is a sorting plugin for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) which provides a simple command that mimics `:sort` and supports both line-wise and delimiter sorting. **Sort** intelligently picks a sorting strategy, by using a configurable priority list, which minimizes manual input and should cover most sorting cases by simply running `:Sort` on a range.

‚ùì Why {#why dir="auto"}
-----

-   Delimiter sorting.
-   Picks sorting strategy intelligently, by using a configurable priority list.
-   Minimize manual input.
-   Efficient and lightweight.
-   Utilize and mimic builtin `:sort` when possible.
-   Silence the nitpicker within you.

üì¶ Installation {#installation dir="auto"}
--------------

#### [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) {#packer dir="auto"}

    -- Lua.

    use({
      'sQVe/sort.nvim',

      -- Optional setup for overriding defaults.
      config = function()
        require("sort").setup({
          -- Input configuration here.
          -- Refer to the configuration section below for options.
        })
      end
    })

#### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) {#vim-plug dir="auto"}

    " Vim Script.

    Plug 'sQVe/sort.nvim'

    " Optional setup for overriding defaults.
    lua << EOF
      require("sort").setup({
        -- Input configuration here.
        -- Refer to the configuration section below for options.
      })
    EOF

‚öô Configuration {#configuration dir="auto"}
---------------

**Sort** comes with the following defaults:

    {
      -- List of delimiters, in descending order of priority, to automatically
      -- sort on.
      delimiters = {
        ',',
        '|',
        ';',
        ':',
        's', -- Space
        't'  -- Tab
       }
    }

üìó Usage {#usage dir="auto"}
-------

demo.mp4

Sorting with **Sort** is easy via the provided `:Sort` command. Two different strategies are utilized depending on the visual selection:

-   Multiple lines

    All arguments provided to `:Sort` are feed to the builtin `:sort` command, and thus mirroring all features provided by the builtin sort. See `:help :sort` for usage and options.

-   Single line

        :[range]Sort[!] [delimiter][b][i][n][o][u][x]

    -   With `[!]` the sort order is reversed.

    -   With `[delimiter]` the delimiter is manually set instead of iterating over `config.delimiters` and sorting by the highest priority delimiter with results. Valid delimiters are:

        -   Any punctuation character (!, ?, &, \...), matching the `%p` lua pattern character class.
        -   `s`: Space
        -   `t`: Tab

    -   With `[b]` sorting is done on the first binary number in the word.

    -   With `[i]` case is ignored.

    -   With `[n]` sorting is done on the first decimal number in the word.

    -   With `[o]` sorting is done on the first octal number in the word.

    -   With `[u]` only keep the first instance of words within selection.
        ***Note*** leading and trailing white space isn\'t considered when testing for uniqueness.

    -   With `[x]` sorting is done on the first hexadecimal number the word. A leading `0x` or `0X` is ignored.

‚å®Ô∏è Keybinding {#keybinding dir="auto"}
-------------

**Sort** does not by default set any keybindings. The following example sets `go`, which you can change to whatever you choose, to trigger `:Sort`:

    " Vim Script.

    nnoremap <silent> go <Cmd>Sort<CR>
    vnoremap <silent> go <Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>

    -- Lua.

    vim.cmd([[
      nnoremap <silent> go <Cmd>Sort<CR>
      vnoremap <silent> go <Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>
    ]])

A common workflow, before sorting, is to visually select inside a set of characters with `vi<character>`. Instead of doing that manually before running **Sort** you could add the keybindings like:

    " Vim Script.

    nnoremap <silent> go" vi"<Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> go' vi'<Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> go( vi(<Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> go[ vi[<Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> gop vip<Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> go{ vi{<Esc><Cmd>Sort<CR>

üèÅ Roadmap {#roadmap dir="auto"}
---------

-   Extend support for delimiter sorting, mirroring `:sort` options:
    -   `b` option to sort by binary (2).
    -   `n` option to sort by decimal (10).
    -   `o` option to sort by octal (8).
    -   `x` option to sort by hexidecimal (16).
-   Decent test coverage.
-   Natural Sorting.
-   Opt-in motion mappings.
