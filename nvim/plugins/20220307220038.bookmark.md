[![Integration](https://github.com/gbprod/cutlass.nvim/actions/workflows/integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gbprod/cutlass.nvim/actions/workflows/integration.yml)

Cutlass overrides the delete operations to actually just delete and not affect the current yank.

It achieves this by overriding the following keys to always use the black hole register: `c`, `cc`, `C`, `s`, `S`, `d`, `dd`, `D`, `x`, `X`. Note that if you have already mapped these keys to something else (like we do below with `x`) then it will not change it again.

Why would you want to do this? {#why-would-you-want-to-do-this dir="auto"}
------------------------------

See [here](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/11/registers-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-parts/).
This plugin [already exists](https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass) in vimscript. I hope this version in lua will be more efficient :)

Usage {#usage dir="auto"}
-----

Requires neovim \> 0.5.0.

Using [https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim](https://github.com/gbprod/cutlass.nvim/blob/main/packer):

    use({
      "gbprod/cutlass.nvim",
      config = function()
        require("cutlass").setup({
            cut_key = "m"
        })
      end
    })

Configuration {#configuration dir="auto"}
-------------

### `cut_key` {#cut_key dir="auto"}

Default : `nil`

After setting up this plugin, all of these operations will simply delete and not cut. However, you will still want to have a key for \'cut\', which you can add by setting the `cut_key` value when setting up the plugin. (`m` or `x` are recommended)

This will create those bindings :

``` {lang="vimscript"}
nnoremap m d
xnoremap m d
nnoremap mm dd
nnoremap M D
```

### `override_del` {#override_del dir="auto"}

Default : `nil`

By default, this plugin doesn\'t remap the `<Del>` key to use the blackhole register (and it will work as the old `x` key). By setting `override_del` to true, `<Del>` key will not cut any more and not afect your current yank.

Integration {#integration dir="auto"}
-----------

If you have [svermeulen/vim-yoink](https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink) installed, it will work seemlessly as original [svermeulen/vim-cutlass](https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-cutlass). Just follow the [integration instructions](https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink#integration-with-vim-cutlass).
