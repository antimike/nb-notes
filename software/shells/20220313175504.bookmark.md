  shell           remarks
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  bash            advanced korn shell (ksh)
  busybox         minimalistic shell
  dash            minimalistic shell, provided as /bin/sh in debian
  elvish          interactive shell, syntax highlighting, DSL, pipe semantics extended for structured data, awesome navigator mode, Ctrl+R history lookup, prefix notation arithmetical operations, functional immutable data structures, well-thought through, implemented in Go
  esh             minimalistic LISP-based shell
  fish            interactive shell with syntax highlighting, tab completion for file & folder paths, syntax is POSIX-inspired but simpler, w/o Ctrl+R for history search, filepath is cd-per-default, unicode characters via \\uXXXX, with Cartesian products for lists and proper range syntax for lists
  ion             rust-based simplified syntax, tab completion for files/dirs broken in xfce4-terminal, neat brace expansion, useful ranges, suugestions by history, Ctrl+R history search, rust-like match statement, custom but POSIX-like redirections, optional type checking for functions
  ksh93           shell giving the basis of POSIX
  mksh            POSIX-like shell used by OpenBSD
  nushell         shell with great representation skills for tabular data, syntax highlighting, auto suggestions for commands and filesystem paths, no tab selection, rust style error messages, no functions, no variables, implemented in rust
  oksh            portable OpenBSD ksh, based on pdksh
  osh             awkward POSIX-shell extensions with shitty documentation
  posh            featureless shell with 9 custom builtin commands
  pdksh           public domain implementation of korn shell
  shell++         OOP shell with large C++ code stack to build, custom glob patterns, python/Go/Javascript-inspired syntax and functions, no tab-completion, broken documentation examples (\' used but \" required), lacks string representation for various types
  tcsh            "C shell with file name completion and command line editing", 12-step compilation instructions requiring adjustments for Ubuntu 20.04, stopped to look into compilation, feature-less POSIX-alternative shell
  xonsh           very advanced python-based shell with autocompletion, pipes, I/O redirection, color syntax support, Ctrl+R history search
  yash            Neat POSIX-compatible shell with many builtin functions and syntax highlighting, Ctrl+R search, tab completion for CLI arguments
  zsh (ohmyzsh)   advanced DSL on top of POSIX shell, rjk & linuxonly & trapd00r themes are okay

  : Table 1. Shell comparison notes

So, what is my conclusion? Which shell shall I pick?

-   Do you need a POSIX shell or want a shell with few main memory requirements?

    -   Yes ⇒ Really?

        -   Yes ⇒ Do you want to study a lot of DSL syntax and thus be powerful?

            -   Yes ⇒ [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)

            -   No ⇒ [yash](https://yash.osdn.jp/index.html.en)

        -   No, not in all details ⇒ [fish](https://fishshell.com/)

    -   No ⇒ What do you prefer?

        -   consistent\|functional ⇒ [elvish](https://elv.sh/)

        -   know-pythonfeature-rich\|heavy-runtime ⇒ [xonsh](https://xon.sh/)

        -   intuitive-representation\|unextendable ⇒ [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)
