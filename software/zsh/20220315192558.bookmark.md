Lightweight workspace manager for the shell.

Desk makes it easy to flip back and forth between different project contexts in
your favorite shell. Change directory, activate a virtualenv or rvm, load
in domain-specific aliases, environment variables, functions, arbitrary shell files,
all in a single command.

Instead of relying on `CTRL-R` to execute and recall (\"that command\'s gotta
be here somewhere\...\"), desk helps shorten and document those actions with
shell aliases and functions, which are then namespaced under a particular
desk.

Because Deskfiles are just enriched shell scripts, the possibilities are
endless. For example, when doing work on AWS I have desk
securely load AWS API keys into environment variables via
[`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) \-- no effort on my part, and no
risk of accidentally persisting that sensitive information to a history file.

I have a hard time calling this a \"workspace manager\" with a straight
face \-- it\'s basically just a shell script that sources another shell script in a new shell.
But I often find myself working in multiple different code trees simultaneously:
the quick context switches and namespaced commands that desk facilitates
have proven useful.

There are no dependencies other than `bash`. Desk is explicitly tested with `bash`,
`zsh`, and `fish`.

    â—²  desk 0.6.0

    Usage:

        desk
            List the current desk and any associated aliases. If no desk
            is being used, display available desks.
        desk init
            Initialize desk configuration.
        desk (list|ls)
            List all desks along with a description.
        desk (.|go) [<desk-name-or-path> [shell-args...]]
            Activate a desk. Extra arguments are passed onto shell. If called with
            no arguments, look for a Deskfile in the current directory. If not a
            recognized desk, try as a path to directory containing a Deskfile.
        desk run <desk-name> <cmd>
            Run a command within a desk's environment then exit. Think '$SHELL -c'.
        desk edit [desk-name]
            Edit (or create) a deskfile with the name specified, otherwise
            edit the active deskfile.
        desk help
            Show this text.
        desk version
            Show version information.

    Since desk spawns a shell, to deactivate and "pop" out a desk, you
    simply need to exit or otherwise end the current shell process.

For example, given this deskfile (`~/.desk/desks/tf.sh`):

    # tf.sh
    #
    # Description: desk for doing work on a terraform-based repository
    #

    cd ~/terraform-repo

    # Set up AWS env variables: <key id> <secret>
    set_aws_env() {
      export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="$1"
      export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="$2"
    }

    # Run `terraform plan` with proper AWS var config
    plan() {
      terraform plan -module-depth=-1 \
        -var "access_key=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" \
        -var "secret_key=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
    }

    # Run `terraform apply` with proper AWS var config
    alias apply='terraform apply'

we\'d get

    $ desk . tf
    $ desk

    tf
    desk for doing work on a terraform repo

      set_aws_env   Set up AWS env variables: <key id> <secret>
      plan          Run `terraform plan` with proper AWS var config
      apply         Run `terraform apply` with proper AWS var config

Basically, desk just associates a shell script (`name.sh`) with a name. When
you call `desk . name`, desk drops you into a shell where `name.sh` has been
executed, and then desk extracts out certain comments in `name.sh` for useful
rendering.

### Installing {#installing dir="auto"}

#### With homebrew {#with-homebrew dir="auto"}

`brew install desk`

#### With curl {#with-curl dir="auto"}

Assuming `~/bin` exists and is on the PATH\... otherwise, substitute `/usr/local/bin`
and add `sudo` as needed.

0.  `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesob/desk/master/desk > ~/bin/desk`
1.  `chmod +x ~/bin/desk`

#### With git {#with-git dir="auto"}

0.  `git clone git@github.com:jamesob/desk.git && cd desk && sudo make install`

After that, run `desk init` and start adding deskfiles with either `desk edit [deskfile name]`
or by manually adding shell scripts into your deskfiles directory (by default `~/.desk/desks/`).

### Enabling shell extensions {#enabling-shell-extensions dir="auto"}

**NB**: Shell extensions are automatically enabled if Desk is installed via Homebrew.

#### Using bash {#using-bash dir="auto"}

0.  Add `source /path/to/desk/repo/shell_plugins/bash/desk` to your `.bashrc`.

#### Using fish {#using-fish dir="auto"}

    mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
    cp /path/to/desk/repo/shell_plugins/fish/desk.fish ~/.config/fish/completions

#### Using zsh {#using-zsh dir="auto"}

0.  Add `fpath=(/path/to/desk/repo/shell_plugins/zsh $fpath)` to your `.zshrc`.

Optionally, use one of the zsh plugin frameworks mentioned below.

#### Using [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) {#using-oh-my-zsh dir="auto"}

0.  `make oh-my-zsh` from within this repo. This sets up a symlink.

or

0.  `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`
1.  `git clone git@github.com:jamesob/desk.git /tmp/desk && cp -r /tmp/desk/shell_plugins/zsh desk`
2.  Add desk to your plugin list

#### Using [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) {#using-antigen dir="auto"}

0.  Add `antigen bundle jamesob/desk shell_plugins/zsh` to your `.zshrc`
1.  Open a new terminal window. Antigen will clone the desk repo and add it to your path.

#### Using [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) {#using-zgen dir="auto"}

0.  Add `zgen load jamesob/desk shell_plugins/zsh` to your `.zshrc` with your other load commands
1.  `rm ~/.zgen/init.zsh`
2.  Start a new shell; zgen will generate a new `init.zsh` and automatically clone the desk repository for you and add it to your path.

### Deskfile rules {#deskfile-rules dir="auto"}

Deskfiles are just shell scripts, nothing more, that live in the desk config directory.
Desk does pay attention to certain kinds of comments, though.

-   *description*: you can describe a deskfile by including `# Description: ...`
    somewhere in the file.

-   *alias and function docs*: if the line above an alias or function is a
    comment, it will be used as documentation.

### Deskfiles {#deskfiles dir="auto"}

Deskfiles are just shell scripts at the root of a project directory that
adhere to the conventions above. These can be put into version control to
formalize and ease common development tasks like running tests or doing
local builds.

For example, if we have some directory or repository called `myproject`, if
we create `myproject/Deskfile`, we\'ll be able to do any of the following:

    $ desk go /path/to/myproject/
    $ desk go /path/to/myproject/Deskfile
    myproject/ $ desk go .
    myproject/ $ desk go

### Sharing deskfiles across computers {#sharing-deskfiles-across-computers dir="auto"}

Of course, the desk config directory (by default `~/.desks`) can be a symlink
so that deskfiles can be stored in some centralized place, like Dropbox,
and so shared across many computers.

### Using a non-default config location {#using-a-non-default-config-location dir="auto"}

By default, desk configuration lives in `~/.desk` (`$DESK_DIR`) and deskfiles
live in `~/.desk/desks` (`$DESK_DESKS_DIR`). If you want to use some other
location, specify as much in `desk init` and then ensure you set `$DESK_DIR`
and/or `$DESK_DESKS_DIR` to match in your shell\'s rc file.

### Shortening invocation {#shortening-invocation dir="auto"}

Typing `desk .` frequently can get old; personally, I like to alias this with

in my shell rc file.

### Usage with OS X {#usage-with-os-x dir="auto"}

Desk won\'t work when used strictly with `~/.bash_profile` on OS X\'s terminal, since
the content of `~/.bash_profile` is only executed on *login*, not shell creation, as
explained [here](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html).

My recommendation is to use `~/.bashrc` as your general-purpose config file, then simply
have `~/.bash_profile` point to it:

    # ~/.bash_profile

    if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
       source ~/.bashrc
    fi
