Lig­a­tures in pro­gram­ming fonts---a mis­guided trend I was hop­ing would col­lapse un­der its own il­logic. But it per­sists. Let me save you some 

time---

Lig­a­tures in pro­gram­ming fonts are a ter­ri­ble 

idea.

And not be­cause I'm a purist or a grump. (Some days, but not to­day.) Pro­gram­ming code has spe­cial se­man­tic con­sid­er­a­tions. Lig­a­tures in pro­gram­ming fonts are likely to ei­ther mis­rep­re­sent the mean­ing of the code, or cause mis­cues among read­ers. So in the end, even if they're cute, the risk of er­ror isn't worth 

it.

First, what are lig­a­tures? [Lig­a­tures](https://practicaltypography.com/ligatures.html) are spe­cial char­ac­ters in a font that com­bine two (or more) trou­ble­some char­ac­ters into one. For in­stance, in ser­ifed text faces, the low­er­case *f* of­ten col­lides with the low­er­case *i* and *l*. To fix this, the *fi* and *fl* are of­ten com­bined into a sin­gle shape (what pros would call a *glyph*).

In this type de­signer's opin­ion, a good lig­a­ture doesn't draw at­ten­tion to it­self: it sim­ply re­solves what­ever col­li­sion would've hap­pened. Ide­ally, you don't even no­tice it's there. Con­versely, this is why I loathe the *Th* lig­a­ture that is the de­fault in many Adobe fonts: it re­solves noth­ing, and al­ways draws at­ten­tion to

itself.

Lig­a­tures in pro­gram­ming fonts fol­low a sim­i­lar idea. But in­stead of fix­ing the odd trou­ble­some com­bi­na­tion, well-in­ten­tioned am­a­teur lig­a­tur­ists are adding dozens of new & strange lig­a­tures. For in­stance, these come from [Fira Code,](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) a heav­ily lig­a­tured spin­off of the open-source

Fira 

Mono.

So what's the prob­lem with pro­gram­ming

ligatures?

1.  **They con­tra­dict Uni­code.** [Uni­code](http://unicode.org/standard/standard.html) is a stan­dard­ized sys­tem---used by all mod­ern fonts---that iden­ti­fies each char­ac­ter uniquely. This way, soft­ware pro­grams don't have to worry that things like the Greek let­ter `Δ` (= up­per­case Delta) might be stashed in some spe­cial place in the font. In­stead, Uni­code des­ig­nates a unique [name and num­ber](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0394/) for each char­ac­ter, called a [*code point*.](http://unicode.org/glossary/#code_point) If you have a `Δ` in your font, you as­so­ciate it with its des­ig­nated Uni­code code point, which is `0x0394`. In ad­di­tion to al­pha­betic char­ac­ters, Uni­code as­signs code points to thou­sands of sym­bols (in­clud­ing
    emoji).
    The prob­lem? Many of the pro­gram­ming lig­a­tures shown above are eas­ily con­fused with ex­ist­ing Uni­code sym­bols. Sup­pose you're look­ing at a code frag­ment that uses Uni­code char­ac­ters and see the sym­bol `≠`. Are you look­ing at a `!=` lig­a­ture that's shaped like `≠`? Or the ac­tual [Uni­code char­ac­ter `0x2260`,](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2260/) which also looks like `≠`? The lig­a­ture in­tro­duces an am­bi­gu­ity that wasn't there
    before.
2.  **They're guar­an­teed to be wrong some­times.** There are a lot of ways for a given se­quence of char­ac­ters, like `!=`, to end up in a source file. De­pend­ing on con­text, it doesn't al­ways mean the same
    thing.
    The prob­lem is that lig­a­ture sub­sti­tu­tion is "dumb" in the sense that it only con­sid­ers whether cer­tain char­ac­ters ap­pear in a cer­tain or­der. It's not aware of the se­man­tic con­text. There­fore, any global lig­a­ture sub­sti­tu­tion is guar­an­teed to be se­man­ti­cally wrong part of the 
    time.

When we're us­ing a ser­ifed text font in or­di­nary [body text](https://practicaltypography.com/body-text.html), we don't have the same con­sid­er­a­tions. An *fi* lig­a­ture al­ways means *f* fol­lowed by *i*. In that case, lig­a­ture sub­sti­tu­tion that ig­nores con­text doesn't change the

meaning.

Still, some ty­po­graphic trans­for­ma­tions in body text can be se­man­ti­cally wrong. For in­stance, [foot and inch marks](https://practicaltypography.com/foot-and-inch-marks.html) are of­ten typed with the same char­ac­ters as quo­ta­tion marks. (See [straight and curly quotes](https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html).) But whereas quo­ta­tion marks want to be curly, foot and inch marks want to be straight (or slanted slightly to the up­per right). So if we ap­ply au­to­matic smart (aka curly) quotes, we have to be care­ful not to cap­ture foot and inch marks in the

transformation.

Does that mean pro­gram­mers can never have nice things? It's to­tally fine to re­design in­di­vid­ual char­ac­ters to dis­tin­guish them from oth­ers. For in­stance, in [Trip­li­cate,](https://practicaltypography.com/triplicate.html) I in­clude a spe­cial "Code" vari­ant that in­cludes re­designed ver­sions of cer­tain char­ac­ters that are eas­ily

confused.

`` `$te_fl{1234*567~890} Reg­u­lar`$te_fl{1234*567~890} Code ``

But in this case, the point is dis­am­bigua­tion: we don't want the low­er­case *l* to look like the digit *1*, nor the zero to look like a cap *O*. Whereas lig­a­tures are go­ing the op­po­site di­rec­tion: mak­ing dis­tinct char­ac­ters ap­pear to be

others.

Bot­tom line: this isn't a mat­ter of taste. In pro­gram­ming code, every char­ac­ter in the file has a spe­cial se­man­tic role to play. There­fore, any kind of "pret­ti­fy­ing" that makes one char­ac­ter look like an­other---in­clud­ing lig­a­tures---leads to a swamp of de­spair. If you don't be­lieve me, try it for 10 or 15

years.

by the way

-   Yes, I do a
    lot of
    programming.

-   "What do you mean, it's not a mat­ter of taste? I like us­ing lig­a­tures when I code." Great! In so many ways, I don't care what you do in pri­vate. Al­though I pre­dict you will even­tu­ally burn your­self on this hot mess, my main con­cern is ty­pog­ra­phy that faces other hu­man be­ings. So if you're prepar­ing your code for oth­ers to read---whether on screen or on pa­per---skip the lig­a­tures. Not least be­cause you won't even know when they go wrong. See [trade­mark and copy­right sym­bols](https://practicaltypography.com/trademark-and-copyright-symbols.html) for a re­lated cau­tion­ary 
    tale.

-   One in­spi­ra­tion for this piece was the La­TeX crowd, who would rou­tinely write me to in­sist their ty­pog­ra­phy was in­fal­li­ble. And yet. I kept see­ing La­TeX-pre­pared books that in­cor­rectly sub­sti­tuted curly quotes for back­ticks. For in­stance, the ex­am­ple be­low is from Kent Dy­b­vig, *The Scheme Pro­gram­ming Lan­guage*, 4th ed. In this chunk of Scheme code, the open­ing-quote marks are sup­posed to be back­ticks; the clos­ing-quote mark is sup­posed to be a sin­gle straight

    quote:

    ![](https://practicaltypography.com/images/dybvig.jpg)

    "But code sam­ples like these aren't really am­bigu­ous, be­cause every­one knows that you don't type the curly quotes." A sloppy ar­gu­ment, though it may be true for lan­guages that only ac­cept ASCII in­put. But many of to­day's pro­gram­ming lan­guages (e.g., [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)) ac­cept UTF-8 in­put. In that case, curly quotes can le­git­i­mately be part of the in­put stream. So am­bi­gu­ity is a real pos­si­bil­ity. Same prob­lem with

    ligatures.

-   The other in­spi­ra­tion for this piece were the peo­ple who re­peat­edly asked me when [Trip­li­cate](https://practicaltypography.com/triplicate.html) would get lig­a­tures, Pow­er­line char­ac­ters, and so on. An­swer, as nicely as pos­si­ble:
    never.
