Summary {#summary dir="auto"}
-------

Neorg (*Neo* - new, *org* - organization) is a tool designed to reimagine organization as you know it.
Grab some coffee, start writing some notes, let your editor handle the rest.

### Why do we need Neorg? {#why-do-we-need-neorg dir="auto"}

There are currently projects designed to [clone org-mode from emacs](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/orgmode.nvim),
then what is the goal of this project?

Whilst those projects are amazing, it\'s simply not enough for us. We need our *own, **better*** solution -
one that will surpass *every* other text editor. It\'s through our frustration of no native solution for Neovim
and inconsistencies in the most popular markup formats that Neorg was born.

To learn more about the philosophy of the project check the [philosophy](#-philosophy) section.

###### ‚ùó **IMPORTANT**: Neorg is *alpha* software. We consider it stable however be prepared for changes and potentially outdated documentation. We are advancing fast and while we are doing our best to keep the documentation up-to-date, this may not always be possible. {#important-neorg-is-alpha-software.-we-consider-it-stable-however-be-prepared-for-changes-and-potentially-outdated-documentation.-we-are-advancing-fast-and-while-we-are-doing-our-best-to-keep-the-documentation-up-to-date-this-may-not-always-be-possible. dir="auto"}

üîß Installation {#installation dir="auto"}
--------------

**Neorg requires at least Neovim 0.6+ to operate.**

You can install it through your favorite plugin manager:

-   [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

        use {
            "nvim-neorg/neorg",
            config = function()
                require('neorg').setup {
                    ... -- check out setup part...
                }
            end,
            requires = "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"
        }

    Every time Neorg hits a new release, a new tag is created by us, so you don\'t have to worry about all the updates inbetween.
    That means, adding `tag = "*"` in Packer will update to latest stable release.

    You can also pin Neorg to one specific version through e.g. `tag = "0.0.9"`.

-   [Packer (with lazyloading)](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

    Want to lazy load? Know that you\'ll have to jump through some hoops and hurdles to get
    it to work perfectly.
    You can use the `ft` key to load Neorg only upon entering a `.norg` file:

        use {
            "nvim-neorg/neorg",
            -- tag = "latest",
            ft = "norg",
            after = "nvim-treesitter", -- You may want to specify Telescope here as well
            config = function()
                require('neorg').setup {
                    ...
                }
            end
        }

    Although it\'s proven to work for a lot of people, you might need additional setups depending on how your lazyloading system is configured.

    One important thing to ask yourself is: \"is it really worth it?\".
    Neorg practically lazy loads itself: only a few lines of code are run on startup, these lines check whether the current
    extension is `.norg`, if it\'s not then nothing else loads. You shouldn\'t have to worry about performance issues when it comes to startup, but
    hey, you do you :)

-   [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

        Plug 'nvim-neorg/neorg' | Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'

    You can then put this initial configuration in your `init.vim` file:

        lua << EOF
        require('neorg').setup {
            ...
        }
        EOF

### Treesitter {#treesitter dir="auto"}

###### *Be sure to have [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) installed on your system for this step!* {#be-sure-to-have-nvim-treesitter-installed-on-your-system-for-this-step dir="auto"}

Neorg\'s main treesitter parser is part of the `nvim-treesitter` repository, and can be installed through:

If you want the parser to be more persistent across different installations of your config, make sure to set `norg` as a parser in the `ensure_installed` table, then run `:TSUpdate`.
If you use the \"maintained\"/\"all\" parser collections then `norg` will be autoincluded.

In addition to the main parser you may also want to install additional subparsers which are injected into the `norg` parser.
To do so, you want to run this code snippet **before** you invoke `require('nvim-treesitter.configs').setup()`:

    local parser_configs = require('nvim-treesitter.parsers').get_parser_configs()

    -- These two are optional and provide syntax highlighting
    -- for Neorg tables and the @document.meta tag
    parser_configs.norg_meta = {
        install_info = {
            url = "https://github.com/nvim-neorg/tree-sitter-norg-meta",
            files = { "src/parser.c" },
            branch = "main"
        },
    }

    parser_configs.norg_table = {
        install_info = {
            url = "https://github.com/nvim-neorg/tree-sitter-norg-table",
            files = { "src/parser.c" },
            branch = "main"
        },
    }

Then run `:TSInstall norg_meta norg_table`.

Here\'s an example config for `nvim-treesitter`, yours will probably be different:

    require('nvim-treesitter.configs').setup {
        ensure_installed = { "norg", "norg_meta", "norg_table", "haskell", "cpp", "c", "javascript", "markdown" },
        highlight = { -- Be sure to enable highlights if you haven't!
            enable = true,
        }
    }

### Troubleshooting Treesitter {#troubleshooting-treesitter dir="auto"}

-   Having a rare occurence where the parser doesn\'t work instantly? Try running `:e`.
    **Still not working**? Uh oh, you\'re stepping on muddy territory. There are several reasons why a parser
    may not work right off the bat, however most commonly it\'s because of plugin loading order.
    Neorg needs `nvim-treesitter` to be up and running before it starts adding colors to highlight groups.
-   Not using packer? Make sure that Neorg\'s `setup()` gets called after `nvim-treesitter`\'s setup.
-   If you\'re on Mac and have compilation errors when doing `:TSInstall`, check out this [fix](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/issues/74#issuecomment-906627223).

üì¶ Setup {#setup dir="auto"}
-------

You\'ve got the basic stuff out the way now, but wait! That\'s not all. You\'ve installed Neorg - great! Now you have to configure it.
By default, Neorg does nothing, and gives you nothing. You must tell it what you care about!

### Default modules {#default-modules dir="auto"}

Neorg runs on *modules*, which are discussed and explained in more depth later on.
Each module provides a single bit of functionality - they can then be stacked together to form
the entire Neorg environment.

The most common module you\'ll find is the `core.defaults` module, which is basically a \"load all features\" switch.
It gives you the full experience out of the box.

The code snippet to enable all default modules is very straightforward:

    require('neorg').setup {
        load = {
            ["core.defaults"] = {}
        }
    }

You can see [here](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/wiki#default-modules) which modules are automatically required when loading `core.defaults`.

‚öô Usage {#usage dir="auto"}
-------

We recommend reading the [spec](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/blob/main/docs/NFF-0.1-spec.md) and familiarizing yourself with the new format.
You can view a summary directly in your neovim instance by running `:h neorg` if you don\'t like reading a lot!

Afterwards it\'s as simple as hopping into a `.norg` file and typing away.

A good first step is to require the `core.norg.dirman` module, it\'ll help you manage Neorg workspaces.
Workspaces are basically isolated directories that you can jump between:

    require('neorg').setup {
        load = {
            ["core.defaults"] = {},
            ["core.norg.dirman"] = {
                config = {
                    workspaces = {
                        work = "~/notes/work",
                        home = "~/notes/home",
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Changing workspaces is easy, just do `:Neorg workspace work`, where `work` is the name of your workspace.
Note that `:Neorg` is only available when the Neorg environment is loaded, i.e. when you\'re
in a `.norg` file or have loaded a `.norg` file already in your Neovim session.

If the Neorg environment isn\'t loaded you\'ll find a `:NeorgStart` command which will launch Neorg and pop
you in to your last (or only) workspace.

#### It works, cool! What are the next steps? {#it-works-cool-what-are-the-next-steps dir="auto"}

We recommend you add some core modules that can greatly improve your experience, such as:

-   Using the concealer module to enable icons (`core.norg.concealer`)
-   Setting up a completion engine (`core.norg.completion`)

Setting these up is discussed in the wiki, so be sure to check there!

**You\'re now basically set**! The rest of this README will be additional information, so keep reading
if you care about what makes Neorg tick, or you want to genuinely get good at using it.

ü•° Modules {#modules dir="auto"}
---------

As you saw previously, we loaded `core.defaults` and recommended that you load `core.norg.dirman`.
As you probably know those are modules. But what are they, exactly?

Modules are basically isolated bits of code that provide a specific subset of features. They can be docked into
the environment at any time and can be essentially stacked together like lego bricks!
They can bind themselves to events and callbacks and communicate with each other.

To require a module, just do:

    require('neorg').setup {
        load = {
            -- Require the module with the default configurations for it
            ["your.required.module"] = {},

            -- Require the module, and override the configurations (with the "config" table)
            ["your.required.module"] = {
                config = {
                    some_option = true
                }
            }
        }
    }

As always, for a little more info you can consult the wiki page [here](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/wiki/Installation#the-concept-of-modules).
To know which configurations are provided by default for a module, just click on their link: you\'ll go to the module page in the [wiki](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/wiki).

### Core Modules {#core-modules dir="auto"}

Here is a list of core modules that aren\'t part of `core.defaults` and can be added
individually by you.

Feel free to try by adding them to your Neorg setup.

List of Core Modules:

  Module name                                                                       Description

    use {
        "nvim-neorg/neorg",
        requires = "john-cena/cool-neorg-plugin",
    }

After that it\'s as easy as loading the module it exposes normally:

    require('neorg').setup {
        load = {
            ["cool.module"] = {},
        }
    }

‚ùì Philosophy {#philosophy dir="auto"}
------------

Our goals are fairly simple:

1.  Revise the org format: simple, extensible, unambiguous. Will make you feel right at home. Alternate markup formats have several flaws, but the most
    notable one is the requirement for **complex parsers**.
    I really advise checking [some writeups](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/beyond-markdown/2787) out on how bad it can get at times.
    What if we told you it\'s possible to alleviate those problems, all whilst keeping that familiar feel?
    Enter the `.norg` file format, whose [base spec](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/blob/main/docs/NFF-0.1-spec.md) is practically complete.
    The cross between all the best things from org and the best things from markdown, revised and merged into one.

2.  Keybinds that *make sense*: vim\'s keybind philosophy is unlike any other, and we want to keep that vibe.
    Keys form a \"language\", one that you can speak, not one that you need to learn off by heart.

3.  Infinite extensibility: no, that isn\'t a hyperbole. We mean it. Neorg is built upon an insanely modular and
    configurable backend - keep what you need, throw away what you don\'t care about. Use the defaults or change \'em.
    You are in control of what code runs and what code doesn\'t run!

4.  Logic: everything has a reason, everything has logical meaning. If there\'s a feature, it\'s there because it\'s necessary, not because
    two people asked for it.
    If something has a more niche use case, it should be documented.

üó∫ Roadmap {#roadmap dir="auto"}
---------

We track a high-level roadmap, so that you can know what to expect. Just do `:h neorg-roadmap`.
To know exactly what\'s being worked on, just check out the [repo\'s PRs](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/pulls).

üìö FAQ {#faq dir="auto"}
-----

The wiki is the go-to place if you need answers to anything Neorg-related. Usage, Keybinds, User Callbacks, Modules, Events?

Massive shoutouts go to all the contributors actively working on the project together to form a fantastic
integrated workflow:

-   [mrossinek](https://github.com/mrossinek) - for basically being my second brain when it comes to developing new features
    and adding new syntax elements
-   [danymat](https://github.com/danymat) - for creating the excellent GTD workflow in Neorg that we literally use internally
    to plan new features

And an extra thank you to:

-   [Binx](https://github.com/Binx-Codes/) - for making that gorgeous logo for free!
-   [bandithedoge](https://github.com/bandithedoge) - for converting the PNG version of the logo into SVG form
